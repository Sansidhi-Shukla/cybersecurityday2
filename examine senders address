Examples of phishing senders email :- 
    1. desktop-support@securesupportcloud[.]com
    2. british-airways@alerting-services[.]com 
    3. transport-for-london-support@alerting-services[.]com

This is who the email appears to come from. It’s one of the first things a recipient sees, and it needs to match the theme of the phishing email.

For example, if you’re sending a phishing email that’s masquerading as a bank, the sender address should use a display name that includes the banks name, and the email address should either use a lookalike domain, obscure domain with a lookalike local-part address or even spoof the domain if possible.

Lets analyse why the first one legit: 
      It is email sent from a service which provides cloud secure services on the desktop. We can decipher this from the senders email itself.
