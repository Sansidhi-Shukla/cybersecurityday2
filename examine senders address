Examples of phishing senders email :- 
    1. desktop-support@securesupportcloud[.]com
    2. british-airways@alerting-services[.]com 
    3. transport-for-london-support@alerting-services[.]com

This is who the email appears to come from. It’s one of the first things a recipient sees, and it needs to match the theme of the phishing email.

For example, if you’re sending a phishing email that’s masquerading as a bank, the sender address should use a display name that includes the banks name, and the email address should either use a lookalike domain, obscure domain with a lookalike local-part address or even spoof the domain if possible.

Lets analyse why the first one legit: 
      It is email sent from a service which provides cloud secure services on the desktop. We can decipher this from the senders email itself.

The email address:

desktop-support@securesupportcloud[.]com

is a good phishing sender because it appears legitimate at first glance, and uses psychological and technical tactics to trick users. Here's why it's effective from a phishing perspective:

🎯 1. Looks Like IT/Tech Support
desktop-support@... implies a help desk or internal IT team.

Many organizations have similar support emails.

Users are conditioned to trust and respond to such addresses, especially when they reference:

Password resets

Account security

System updates

🌐 2. Domain Seems Professional
securesupportcloud.com sounds like a real tech/cloud security service.

Words like:

secure

support

cloud
evoke trust and imply legitimacy.

🔎 But it’s fake:
It’s not a known brand like Microsoft or AWS.

It may be a newly registered domain used only for phishing.

🕵️ 3. Bypasses Quick Suspicion
No obvious red flags like freegift123@yahoo.com or randomdomain.ru.

Uses business-style formatting to evade basic spam/phishing filters.

📬 4. Spoofs Real Roles
Targets are more likely to respond to:

IT support

Security alerts

Admin account actions

🧠 5. Psychological Pressure
Phishing emails from such addresses often use urgency, like:

“Your account has been compromised. Click here to verify immediately.”

Combined with a realistic sender, users may click before thinking.
