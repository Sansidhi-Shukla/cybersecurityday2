What Is Online Header Analysis?
Online header analysis is the process of using tools or services to analyze the full email headers of a received message in order to:

  1. Identify the true sender

  2. Detect forged/spoofed addresses

  3. Check mail server IPs and geolocation

  4. Review SPF, DKIM, and DMARC results

  5. Trace the delivery route

  6. Spot anomalies indicating phishing, spoofing, or spam
